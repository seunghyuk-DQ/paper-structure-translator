# Structure-Preserving Paper Translator

[English](README.md) | [한국어](README.ko.md)

OpenAI-compatible pipeline for making clean Korean paper-viewer HTML from ar5iv HTML.

The goal is not to summarize a paper. The goal is to keep the paper readable like a normal article page while translating the body text as literally as possible.

## Preview

The generated HTML is meant to feel like a quiet paper reader: figures and tables stay in place, citations remain clickable, and the translated body text is easy to read line by line.

| Korean reader | English/Korean parallel reader |
| --- | --- |
| ![Korean paper reader](docs/korean-reader.png) | ![English and Korean parallel paper reader](docs/parallel-reader.png) |

The bilingual output includes an `원본 보기` mode with English on the left and Korean on the right. Scroll sync is enabled by default, but you can turn it off, adjust either side manually, then turn it back on without moving the current view. Future scrolls continue in sync from that state.

## Features

- Uses ar5iv HTML instead of PDF parsing.
- Masks HTML tags before calling the model, then restores the exact tags after translation.
- Sends only translatable text blocks to the model.
- Keeps `figure.ltx_table` table HTML unchanged to save tokens and avoid breaking tables.
- Preserves links, citations, figures, equations, code/pre/math blocks, and document structure.
- Adds a clean paper-viewer style: centered white page, white background, readable typography.
- Writes Korean-only HTML and bilingual English/Korean HTML.
- Provides a two-column bilingual reader with optional scroll sync.
- Writes JSONL caches so interrupted runs can resume.

## Agent Ready

This repository includes instructions for coding agents. If you are using Codex, Claude Code, or a similar agent, give it this repository URL and point it to:

- `AGENTS.md` for the full agent operating guide.
- `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code-specific defaults.
- `skills/paper-structure-translator/SKILL.md` for reusable skill-style instructions.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill `.env` locally:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://host:port/v1
```

`.env`, downloaded sources, caches, and generated HTML outputs are ignored by git.

## Quick Start

Check the local environment:

```bash
./paper-translator doctor
```

Fetch source HTML with explicit CLI flags:

```bash
./paper-translator fetch \
  --paper-id mmdocrag \
  --source-url https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2505.16470v2
```

Agent-friendly JSON output is available on every command:

```bash
./paper-translator doctor --json
```

Run a dry run to inspect block counts before calling the model:

```bash
./paper-translator translate \
  --paper-id mmdocrag \
  --dry-run
```

Then run the translation:

```bash
./paper-translator translate --paper-id mmdocrag
```

The output files are:

```text
outputs/mmdocrag.ko.paper.html
outputs/mmdocrag.ko-en.paper.html
```

`*.ko.paper.html` is the Korean-only viewer.  
`*.ko-en.paper.html` starts with a Korean-only view. Click `원본 보기` to switch to a two-column reader with English on the left and Korean on the right.

## Translate Another Paper

Pass a new ar5iv URL directly to the CLI. It will derive the default input, output, cache, and bilingual output paths from `--paper-id`.

```bash
./paper-translator translate \
  --paper-id your-paper \
  --source-url https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/... \
  --dry-run
```

Remove `--dry-run` when the block count looks right.

## Re-apply Viewer Style or Restore Tables

If you already have translated HTML and only want to refresh the viewer CSS or restore source tables:

```bash
./paper-translator restyle --paper-id mmdocrag
```

## Scripts

- `paper-translator`: CLI wrapper that runs `scripts/paper_translator.py` through `uv`.
- `scripts/paper_translator.py`: agent-aware CLI for `doctor`, `fetch`, `translate`, `restyle`, and `serve`.
- `scripts/translate_html_blocks.py`: masks tags, translates text blocks, restores tags, writes paper-viewer HTML.
- `scripts/apply_paper_viewer_style.py`: reapplies viewer CSS, fixes ar5iv asset links, optionally restores original table HTML.

## Notes

Use this for documents you have the right to translate. Full translated paper outputs should stay local unless redistribution is permitted.
